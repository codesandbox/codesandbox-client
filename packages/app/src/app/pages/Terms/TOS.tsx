    <p>
      Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of
      and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users
      and others who access or use the Service. Any information submitted by you
      shall be subject to CodeSandbox{'\''}s{' '}
      <Link to="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>. One person or legal
      entity may not maintain more than one Account. Accounts registered by
      “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.
    </p>

    <p>
      By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If
      you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the
      Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

    <p>
      Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ({'"'}Subscription(s){'"'}).
      You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ({'"'}Billing
      Cycle{'"'}). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
      renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Bas en Ives
      VOF cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
      your online account management page or by contacting Bas en Ives VOF
      customer support team.
    </p>

    <p>
      A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the
      payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Bas en Ives VOF with
      accurate and complete billing information including full name, zip code,
      and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment
      information, you automatically authorize Bas en Ives VOF to charge all
      Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment
      instruments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Bas en Ives VOF
      will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
      manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
      corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
    </p>

    <h2>Fee Changes</h2>

    <p>
      Bas en Ives VOF, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
      Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will
      become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bas en Ives VOF will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any
      change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
      Subscription before such change becomes effective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes
      into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription
      fee amount.
    </p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>

    <p>
      Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Bas en Ives
      VOF on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Bas en Ives
      VOF.
