## California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and
online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond
California to require any person or company in the United States (and
conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on
its website stating exactly the information being collected and those
individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:

## According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:

Users can visit our site anonymously.

Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page
or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.

Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on

## COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the
age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer
protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety
online.

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from
children under 13?

## Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in
the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role
in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the
Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is
critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal
information.

### In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

We will notify you via email

- Within 1 business day

**We will notify the users via in-site notification**

- Within 1 business day

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data
collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires
not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

## CAN SPAM Act

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes
