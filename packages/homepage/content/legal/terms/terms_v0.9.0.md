These Terms of Use govern your relationship with CodeSandbox regarding the use
of our Services served via our Domains and accessed conveniently on
codesandbox.io.

Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using the Service because if you
access or use our Service, you agree to be bound to these Terms. If you disagree
with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

These Terms apply to all Users. Any information submitted by you shall be
subject to [/legal/privacy](CodeSandbox's Privacy Policy).

Please reach out to us via our contact details below as soon as possible if you
or anyone in your company using CodeSandbox feels uninformed, finds anything on
our websites to be unfair, incompletely explained or surprising.

If you use Content originating from our Service (regardless whether it contains
User Generated Content and/or Your Content) elsewhere, these Terms of Use remain
applicable to that Content.

To further clarify the terms we are using, please refer to the glossary at the
end of this document. Please reach out to us via our contact details below as
soon as possible if you or anyone in your company using CodeSandbox feels
uninformed, finds anything on our websites to be unfair, incompletely explained
or surprising.

## 1. Account

1.  When you create an Account with us, you must provide us information that is
    true, accurate, complete and current at all times. Please update your
    information if anything changes. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of
    the Terms, which may result in termination of your Account on our Service.
2.  You can create a CodeSandbox Account via a third-party service. In order to
    protect yourself, us and our other users, please make sure that you keep
    these third-party service accounts secure.
3.  You agree not to let any third party use your Account. You must notify us
    immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized
    use of your Account. Our contact details are at the end of this document.

## 2. Intellectual Property: Ownership

1.  Content that you create remains Your Content. This means that by using our
    platform no intellectual property rights are transferred from you to us.
2.  It is your responsibility to make sure that Your Content does not infringe
    intellectual property rights of any other party. This means that if you use
    Content that you have not created from scratch yourself, you need to make
    sure that you have sufficient permission to use this Content. You usually
    need (i) a license to use another party’s content or work and (ii) if you
    have obtained a license or an open source license applies to the relevant
    content: You need to comply with the terms and conditions of that license.
3.  If we are held liable for infringement of third party intellectual property
    rights as a result of your actions or omissions, you shall indemnify us and
    hold us harmless. This means that you will have to pay all our damages
    including legal fees.

## 3. Intellectual property: License

1.  Public Sandboxes that existed prior to the effective date of these Terms
     are MIT licensed by default, these Terms becoming applicable do not change
    that situation.
2.  As of the effective date of these Terms, Sandboxes are public by default,
    but it is up to you to define the license terms for Sandboxes you have
    control over. There is however an important condition here: If you have a
    public Sandbox, you give permission to other Users to fork (read: copy) Your
    Sandbox. Similarly, you are allowed to fork public Sandboxes of other Users.
    This means that if you choose certain license terms for your public Sandbox,
    these license terms have to allow for forking. Basically, this means open
    source licensing, and you decide the type of open source license.
3.  You also permit us to use Your Content for promotional activities. Rest
    assured that all of our users have to comply with these Terms of Use and
    that none of our users are allowed to use any content to break the law or
    cause you, us or any other user damage.
4.  You can control visibility and forking permissions of a Sandbox by opting
    for one of our plans. For private or unlisted Sandboxes  it is up to you to
    define license terms. Other Users do not have permission to fork Sandboxes
    controlled by you.
5.  Your right to control visibility and forking permissions (see above) can be
    used at any time, meaning that you can switch to one of our plans whenever
    you want to. There is something important to bear in mind though: Any
    Content may have been forked when public and thus be used by third parties.
    Undoing is not an option or a right, nor would it be possible to forbid such
    third parties from further use of that Content. So only (new/adjusted)
    Content that you create after you switch to a private or unlisted Sandbox
    can be controlled by you in terms of visibility and forking permissions.
     Please be aware you can switch default visibility mode for Sandboxes on our
    Website.
6.  In any case, you grant us and our legal successors the right to store,
    archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as
    necessary to provide our services, including improving our services over
    time. This license includes the right to copy Your Content to our servers
    and/or databases and make backups; parse it into a search index or otherwise
    analyze it on our servers.

## 4. Intellectual Property: Third-Party Links and Services

1.  Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are
    not owned or controlled by us.
2.  We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content,
    privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You
    further acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable,
    directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be
    caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content,
    goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.
3.  We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies
    of any third-party web sites or services that you visit.

## 5. Subscriptions: Pricing and Payment

1.  Some parts of the Service are only available to you if you have a
    CodeSandbox Account. An overview of our subscription plans pricing are
    available at https://codesandbox.io/pricing. You must create an Account to
    purchase one of our plans.
2.  We use various payment service providers, depending on your subscription
    plan. For new plans from the effective date of these Terms, the order
    process is conducted by our partner and merchant of record paddle.com. This
    means Paddle provides all customer service inquiries, handles returns and
    provides you invoices. For legacy plans, we use our partner Stripe.com who
    provides invoices. You pay the invoices from our partners directly to them.
3.  With respect to payment of your subscription plan, when prompted, you will
    have to comply with the payment terms of the relevant payment service
    provider. If no such payment terms have been agreed upon, the following
    conditions on pricing and payment shall apply:
4.  You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing
    Cycle"). Billing cycles depend on your choice: you may choose either a
    monthly or an annual cycle.
5.  At the end of each Billing Cycle, your subscription plan will automatically
    renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or CodeSandbox
    cancels it. You may cancel your subscription renewal either through your
    online account management page or by contacting us via the details below.
6.  CodeSandbox, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the pricing
    for subscription plans. Any change in pricing will become effective at the
    end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
7.  CodeSandbox will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in
    pricing to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before
    such change becomes effective. So if you do not agree with proposed pricing
    changes, it is up to you to terminate your subscription per the end of the
    then current Billing Cycle.
8.  Your continued use of the Service offered on the basis of your applicable
    subscription plan after changes in pricing come into effect constitutes your
    agreement to pay the modified prices for your subscription plan if
    applicable.
9.  We may suspend the Service based on your subscription plan to you if you do
    not pay your invoice(s) timely.
10. If you are a consumer and purchase one of our subscription plans you have
    the right to dissolve the agreement within 14 days after conclusion of the
    agreement. For convenience, this right is also explained in our FAQ.

## 6. Acceptable Use, Abuse and Misuse: What not to do or else

1.  You are not allowed to use our Service for the creation of Content that you
    – or someone else permitted by you – intend to use in a way that does not

    for instance that it is not allowed to create Content and use such Content
    for phishing.

    Content from our Service and give it to someone else to use it in a way that
    does not comply with the law and/or otherwise causes damage to anyone.

    diminishing the importance of other laws and regulations – are privacy laws:
    do not create or upload content to our platform that violates any applicable
    privacy law.
5.  You are not allowed to create, transmit, upload or distribute content on/to
    our Service that contains harmful elements (such as viruses, worms, or any
