### A New Dashboard Built for Collaboration

We've introduced teams and refreshed the design of the dashboard to make
collaborating on sandboxes a better experience.

#### Features

1. Team dashboard enable you to work on sandboxes with teams of people and keep
   your personal projects separate
2. A new start screen that lists only the most recent stuff you're likely to
   want to dive back in to
3. By default, new projects now go into drafts so important sandboxes are easier
   to find
4. List view is perfect for those of you with a large number of sandboxes
5. The dashboard is now keyboard accessible, so you can move around and open
   sandboxes using only keys
6. The design is responsive, so you can get to your sandboxes quicker when on
   mobile
7. You can now reload the preview with CMD+SHIFT+R

#### Fixes

- Made bracket matches more apparent in the CSB Black theme
- We now close the modal after importing a GitHub repo on the Create Sandbox
  screen
- Fixed an issue with being unable to save all after reloading a sandbox with
  unsaved changes
- [@jyash97](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client/pull/4487) made
  sure you can't invite yourself to a team
