At CodeSandbox, our mission is to enable creators to build and share their
ideas. By removing complexity and simplifying collaboration, we want to allow
everyone to create things with code and share them with friends, colleagues, or
the world. Profile pages on CodeSandbox are where you can share your sandboxes
and let folks know a little bit about yourself and your creations. They're a
great place to showcase your work and link from your website, social bio, or
resume.

Today, we're releasing an update, which refreshes the design of profile pages,
evolving them to showcase yourself in the best way possible. Let's step through
the key changes by looking at the profile pages of some community members.

## A little bit about you

The first section is all about you. There's your profile image, username, as
well as your bio. Here you can tell folks what you're all aboutâ€”your passions,
specialties, and the kinds of things you work on. Below that, you can add links
to other sites, like your personal homepage and the social profiles you use.
Like [Tiffany White](https://codesandbox.io/u/twhite96), for example, who in
addition to their GitHub profile, links to their personal site and Twitch stream
too.

## Showcase your sandboxes

![Community Member Profiles](https://sk8cl.csb.app/AllProfiles.jpg) One of the
main parts of the new profile page is the header. You can optionally embed a
sandbox of your choice, which captures what your creations are all about. It
could be an [interactive visualization](https://codesandbox.io/u/DannyRuchtie),
an [example for a library you made](https://codesandbox.io/u/camflan), or, if
you're like [Sanne](https://codesandbox.io/u/sannek), a cute cat that watches
your cursor move around the page.

Beneath that, you can pin other sandboxes that you'd like to highlight.
[Paul Henschel](https://codesandbox.io/u/drcmda), the creator of
react-three-fiber, chose to pin four sandboxes demoing different features of
that library. There's no limit here, so choose as many or as few as you like.
After that, we list all your other public projects, which folks can list either
by view count or chronologically by creation date.

This profile update is part of a series of design work we've undertaken across
CodeSandbox, including new looks for our
[editor](https://codesandbox.io/post/new-look-editor) and
[dashboard](https://codesandbox.io/post/new-dashboard).

All new user profiles are live now, so jump in and make your profile your own.
