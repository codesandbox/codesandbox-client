  We're happy to announce Discover, the place where we highlight great and
  inspiring sandboxes!

CodeSandbox started with the premise that it should be incredibly easy for
people to share their JavaScript ideas and projects. We released CodeSandbox
with that idea 4 years ago, and today, already more than 16 million(!) sandboxes
have been created on CodeSandbox! And that number is growing quite fast, even in
the last week alone we've seen 213 thousand new sandboxes being created.

In those sandboxes there are so many unnoticed gems, and it's a shame that these
sandboxes have been hidden without too much attention. Until now, the only way
to find these interesting sandboxes was by accidentally finding the right tweet.
That's why we started to work on new ways to highlight the great sandboxes that
are being created. And today, we're excited to announce our latest work on this:
the [Discover page](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/discover)!

### The Discover Page

In the dashboard you'll find a new item in your sidebar, called Discover. On
this page we've collected many inspiring, beautiful and clever sandboxes we've
found on CodeSandbox, and organised these sandboxes into collections. This page
is a great way to find inspiration or just to look at what others are working
on.

With this, we want to make it extremely easy for people to discover and share
work from each-other, and encourage more people to share what they've been
working on.

### More to come

This is our first iteration of the
[Discover page](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/discover). In the future, we'll
make it possible for you to customise and create your own collections that you
can share. With this, we're making sharing a core part of CodeSandbox

We'll update this page regularly, so that every time you visit, you'll find some
new interesting sandboxes on there. We could definitely use help with finding
new sandboxes, so if you have created a great sandbox or have found one, please
send us a tweet on [@codesandbox](https://twitter.com/codesandbox)!

Let us know what you think! Don't hesitate to shoot us a message on
support@codesandbox.io or on Twitter. Big thanks to
