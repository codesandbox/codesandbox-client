title: Introducing Teams
description: A new dashboard that's built for collaboration.

While we often write code alone, creating products typically takes a whole group
of people to work together. That's why we've rebuilt our dashboard with
collaboration in mind, putting teams at its core.

Teams are where individuals and teams of people can create and organize
sandboxes. They enable you to keep your personal and work projects separate, as
well as manage sandboxes more effectively. Everyone gets a private dashboard,
where you can experiment, work on side-projects, and keep whichever sandboxes
you want to yourself. But now you can create team dashboards too. You might
create one or more to work with a team, or on various projects. Then invite your
friends and colleagues to join you, so you can all work on a set of shared
sandboxes, sorted into folders. This is the best way to collaborate together on
sandboxes.

You can create a new team [here](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/settings/new)!
In the future, you'll be able to set team-level settings and secrets too.

## A new-look dashboard

But team dashboards aren't the only new thing. While staying close to what
people are familiar with, we've refreshed the look and feel of the dashboard.
This update evolves the design to bring through the
[updates made in the editor](https://codesandbox.io/post/new-look-editor) and
makes working with large numbers of sandboxes a much better experience too.

### A new start screen

You now start from the home screen. The home screen lists only the last few
templates and sandboxes you've used—the stuff you're most likely to want to dive
back in to. We've also added a 'recently modified' section, which shows the
sandboxes edited today, in the last seven days, as well as within the last
month. So you no longer need to trawl through a big list of sandboxes to pick
out a new sandbox you want to carry on with.

### My Drafts

With that said, you don't need to go back to most of the sandboxes you create.
That's part of the value of CodeSandbox, but this wasn't catered to by the old
dashboard design. So we've added a new section called 'My Drafts' that collects
together all the sandboxes you don't categorize yourself. Such projects would
clutter the old dashboard and make the projects you did want to go back to
harder to find. By default, new sandboxes now go into drafts.

### Other dashboard improvements

There are other UX improvements too. There's now a list view, perfect for those
with a large number of sandboxes. The dashboard is keyboard accessible, so you
can move around and open sandboxes using only keys. The design is responsive, so
you can get to your sandboxes quicker when you're on mobile, and we've tweaked
drag-and-drop to make it easier to move groups of sandboxes between folders.

## Notifications

We've also updated the design of notifications. You're forgiven if you didn't
know we have notifications—they've only been used for team invitations in the
dashboard to date. Now they're shown in the editor as well and let you know
about new sandbox invitations too. Notifications will become increasingly useful
as we deliver on more of our
[planned collaboration features](https://codesandbox.io/post/redefining-code-collaboration),
which is why we've also added new filter and dismiss options.

## Join the Team Pro waiting list

For individuals, these updates make the dashboard a more productive starting
point to jump back into projects and stay organized when you have large numbers
of sandboxes.

For teams, it's a big step forward in being able to collaborate and work
together.
[Sign up for the Team Pro waiting list](https://airtable.com/shrlgLSJWiX8rYqyG)
to be one of the first to try other upcoming team features that will forever
change how you work with others to create things with code.
