CodeSandbox is on a mission to empower web developers and make it easy to build solutions that can change the world. 

For this reason, we partnered with [Ingressive4Good](https://ingressive.org), a non-profit developer community from Lagos, Nigeria that launched in July 2020 with a bold mission to train 1 million African youths with tech skills. 

We had a month-long challenge for members of the Ingressive4Good community to build solutions for a problem statement using CodeSandbox.

### Problem Statement
Ingressive4Good noticed a challenge amongst their smaller community organizers - which included tools to help promote their events. Having a local platform where users can create and share personalized event Display pictures (DP) would increase their campaign reach and also give events more visibility.

The goal was to identify the top 3 individuals/teams that will be able to build a solution for this in the specified time period. 

### The Challenge
Over 290 people applied with 155 active participants for the duration of this challenge and these are the top projects.

It's been an amazing experience for the participating developers and some have gone on to share their [experience with the challenge](https://medium.com/@kamaldeensulyman99/my-experience-about-i4g-hackathon-1ed364b3eb23).

### Winners
