Last May we announced that play.js was joining CodeSandbox to enable web development on mobile. Carlos, the creator of play.js, has been hard at work since then. Today, we're happy to announce Play.js Live. From today, you can edit sandboxes directly from play.js, while real-time collaborating with anyone from CodeSandbox. This means that you can now collaborate with others and create sandboxes *while working from your iPad or iPhone*!

Let's take a look!

### Collaborate in real time with CodeSandbox

Real-time collaboration is something that CodeSandbox had since [our announcement of CodeSandbox Live](https://codesandbox.io/post/introducing-codesandbox-live-real-time-code-collaboration-in-the-browser). With it, you can easily collaborate with others on the same sandbox at the same time. This is very useful for many use cases, like pair-programming, interviews or when working together on something.

With this update, you can now do it from anywhere! When you're on the go and someone has a question, you can just open the iPad/iPhone and immediately see what they're working on. If you're working on your laptop, but want to continue on your iPad, that's now possible by just opening your iPad and continuing from there!

With real-time collaboration you can see others editing a project and other can see you too. Pair programming, helping, teaching or learning… these are now possible from anywhere!

### Create & Manage Sandboxes

Creating a sandbox is as easy as signing in with your CodeSandbox account and selecting a template to get you started. It will automatically become available online for you to edit from any other device or share with anyone.

### What's Next

Now that we have full integration of play.js with CodeSandbox, you can work on sandboxes directly from your iPad or iPhone. At CodeSandbox we've been hard at work for the last 8 months on something new, and we're close to announcing it. With the whole team we've set our sights on this, and we're also building a first-class integration for play.js as well. We'll officially announce this in 2 to 3 months!
