Web animations, especially when used right, help create fun, interactive and engaging experiences for your website visitors. However, more often than not, they can be quite difficult to implement. 

As [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) is dedicated to making web developers as productive as possible, we partnered with [Greensock](https://greensock.com/) (GSAP) to host some fun and creative challenges for the month of April. Greensock puts a lot of animation power in the hands of developers through it's robust JavaScript library and they have now made all the [Club Greensock](https://greensock.com/club/) premium plugins now available on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) via npm. ðŸ”¥

Every week through April, we shared a new creative coding challenge and a sandbox to get started building something fun. You can find out all about the challenges at [https://greensock.com/challenges](https://greensock.com/challenges).

## Challenges

The first challenge encouraged everyone to build something fun on `Scrolling animations with ScrollTrigger`. There were a lot of amazing submissions but [Victor](https://twitter.com/victorwork_) and [Ismael](https://twitter.com/ismamz) took the top spots.
