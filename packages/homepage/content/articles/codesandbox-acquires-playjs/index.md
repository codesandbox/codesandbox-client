  Announcing CodeSandbox has Acquired Play.js, a Native JavaScript IDE for iOS
description:
  We're super excited to announce that CodeSandbox has acquired play.js! On top
  of that, we're making play.js free and integrated with CodeSandbox. This is
  our first step to mobile-first development.

Over the past few years we’ve seen a shift in how people use their tablets. When
the first iPad was released, many people saw it as a bigger phone, but nowadays
more and more people are starting to see tablets as a possible replacement for
laptops. You can see it in every way: tablets are becoming more powerful,
trackpads on tablets are becoming more commonplace and we see more creator apps
like Photoshop pop up on the app store.

We also saw this at CodeSandbox. One of our biggest feature requests has always
been proper mobile support, and over the past two years the request for it has
grown tremendously. And come to think of it, it makes a lot of sense! New ideas
often pop up when you’re on the go, and it should be easy to then quickly create
a sandbox to try that idea, even if you don’t have a laptop with you.

That’s why we’re excited to announce that CodeSandbox has acquired
[play.js](https://playdotjs.com/)! Play.js, created by Carlos Vidal, is an app
for iOS (both iPhone and iPad) that makes it incredibly easy for you to develop
web applications. Just like with CodeSandbox, you can press a button and
immediately get a running application that you can edit and play with. And,
well, unlike CodeSandbox, it’s a native app built for iOS that makes it very
smooth to use on your iPhone and iPad.

In the next 5 years development on a tablet or phone will become much more
commonplace. In fact, even right now many people use their phone or tablet as
their main driver. It should be just as easy for them to do development, and
we’re happy to make our first steps in this direction today.

## What does this mean?

Carlos, the creator of play.js, joins the CodeSandbox team and will fully
integrate CodeSandbox together with play.js. We just deployed the first update
in this direction: from today you can import your sandboxes within play.js. On
top of that we’re also making play.js free, which means you can try it out
directly by installing it

### What’s Next

Over the upcoming months we’ll create a closer integration with play.js and
CodeSandbox. We’re going to make it possible to work on CodeSandbox and play.js
at the same time, and have live collaboration between the two. This way, you can
work on a sandbox from your computer and continue from your iPad or iPhone when
you’re on the go. It will be seamless.

Finally, we’ve been more quiet than usual over the past 6 months. We’re working
on something new that will change how you can use CodeSandbox. We want everyone
to be able to develop from anywhere, in any way they want, and the acquisition
of play.js is a milestone toward much more to come. More will be shared around
summer!

### Conclusion

We’ve been talking with Carlos for a long time about this, and I’m so excited
that we’re now able to completely build out a native mobile experience for
CodeSandbox! Developing on CodeSandbox from your phone or tablet is only
becoming better, and with the updates we have lined up for the summer you’ll
soon be able to work on any project from anywhere.

We’re curious about what you think, if you have any feedback or an idea you’d
like us to hear, don’t hesitate to [let us know](mailto:support@codesandbox.io)!
