### Get users started faster with templates and demos

Provide starting points for your product, which folks can fork to get started
quickly—helping them avoid writing boilerplate code while encouraging best
practices.

Expand upon these starting points with more advanced demos—show off individual
features and common use-cases of your product with code examples.

</div>

<div>

### Make documentation interactive

Embed or link to worked examples from your reference docs to make them
interactive. By sharing real examples, people can see both the code and a
running version of it. They then only need to fork it to begin working with your
product right away.

If your code examples already live on GitHub, then add an import to CodeSandbox
link. That way users can run your code and see what it does without having to
set anything up locally.

</div>

<div>

### Educate users with blog posts and tutorials

You can use embeds or link to sandboxes in your blog posts and how-to tutorials.
Demo new features, or walk users through the code and provide a working example
to start from at the end.

</div>

<div>

### Collaborate on code

With no setup or things to install, folks just need a browser to be able to
watch you code live or work in a sandbox. Share a sandbox for real-time
collaboration and let multiple people view or edit code at the same time.

</div>

<div>

### Run better workshops and hackathons

CodeSandbox works in the browser, so there's nothing to install, and you don't
need to set up machines for attendees. By creating templates to start from
alongside worked solutions, attendees can go through exercises in the class and
continue with them at home. All sandboxes are live, so you can collaborate on
code with attendees or help those that get stuck along the way.

With support for backend as well as frontend development, you can kickstart
projects at Hackathons. Give attendees a template to start from or repo to
import from GitHub. They can then add any package on npm or fork and re-use code
from our 10M+ community-created sandboxes.

</div>

<div>

### Provide more effective support

Give users a template they can use to provide reproducible bug reports. This
makes it easier for you to investigate the issue while ruling out environment
issues and setup problems.

If users get stuck or have a question, you can give them working example code
solutions in response. Share a sandbox so they can see where they went wrong, or
provide a workaround to keep them moving forward.
