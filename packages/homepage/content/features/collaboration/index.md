  or more folks to collaborate on code—in real-time, or asynchronously as part
  of a team.

### Team up on code

With just a click, you can turn any sandbox into a collaborative coding
environment and pair with friends and colleagues on code, or work together in a
team.

With nothing to install, Live lets you collaborate on code in real-time, you can
see what others are typing, and preview changes as you make them. Everyone gets
a cursor, so you can see who is working on what and where. The integrated live
chat means you can discuss whatever it is you’re working on directly in the
editor.

### Work better together

You can create a team, enabling you to share sandboxes with team members and
work on them together.

You can also make team templates to give everyone starter apps created around
the libraries and components you use. You’re able to be more productive with
consistent coding styles and conventions as part of your workflow.
