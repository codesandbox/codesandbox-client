  Collaborative coding environments can be tricky to set up. CodeSandbox helps
  break down the barriers to building together by making it easy for two or more
  folks to collaborate on code—in real-time, or asynchronously as part of a
  team.

### Team up on code

Every sandbox is a collaborative coding environment for you to pair with friends
and colleagues on code, or work together in a team.

With nothing to install, CodeSandbox lets you collaborate on code in real-time,
you can see what others are typing, and preview changes as you make them.
Everyone gets a cursor, so you can see who is working on what and where. The
integrated live chat means you can discuss whatever it is you’re working on
directly in the editor.

### Work better together

You can create a team dashboard, enabling you to share sandboxes with team
members and work on them together.

You can also make team templates to give everyone starter apps created around
the libraries and components you use. You’re able to be more productive with
consistent coding styles and conventions as part of your workflow.
