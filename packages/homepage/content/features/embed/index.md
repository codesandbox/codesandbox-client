### Customize the look and feel

Show just the editor, the preview or both. Then enable auto-resizing, the
navigation bar, console, module view, or test results. Specify which file shows
first in the editor, and the path the preview displays.

### Small in size, big in flexibility

Designed to be lightweight on the page while providing visitors with the ability
to view code, the running app, or both at the same time. Toggle features to find
your preferred balance of filesize and functionality.

### Embed everywhere

You can place embeds with an iFrame, or anywhere with Embedly support, like
