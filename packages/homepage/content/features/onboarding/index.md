### Make developer onboarding docs interactive

Embed sandboxes in your internal training documents, so you can demonstrate
coding conventions, explain concepts, and show example components. Meaning new
team members understand your team's best practices from the get-go.

</div>

<div>

### Share sandboxes for fast feedback

When you send a link to a sandbox, you're sharing both the code and the running
app. So fellow developers and designers can provide input and guidance on work,
keeping new hires on the right track.

<div>

### Skip the environment setup slog

CodeSandbox works in a web browser, with nothing to install and no environment
set up. So you can get straight to working with code and leave setting up dev
environments until later.

<div>

### Bake-in best practices

Create workspace templates which provide starting points for new projects,
pre-configured with styles, libraries, and settings that work exactly how you
need them to.
