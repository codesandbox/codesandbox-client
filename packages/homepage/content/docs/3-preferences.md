## Preferences Profiles

Preferences Profiles allow you to save a snapshot of your current CodeSandbox and editor 
preferences as a profile, which you can then apply to re-use them when you’re on another
device.

## How to create a new Preference Profile

To save a snapshot of your current preferences you can open 
`Preferences` located in the menu at the top right of your
screen.

From there navigate to `Preferences Profiles` and you will see a button saying
`Create new profile`:

![Create a Profile](./images/preferences-create.png)

By clicking it we will save your preferences to the cloud so that they can be
retrieved later and applied when on another computer.

## Applying your preferences on another device

After creating your first profile you will get an updated interface that will
have a list of your profiles.

From here you can apply all your preferences using the `Apply` button on the menu:

![Apply Profile](./images/preferences-apply.png)

This will apply all the preferences and ask you to reload
the page to see them in action.

## Can I download a profile to my computer?

Yes, you can create a new Profile and download it, this will give 
you a JSON file you can then import on another computer using the 
`Import existing profile` button.

After this is done you are also welcome to remove this profile and it will still
be applied.

You can use this to have several CodeSandbox profiles.

## Can I have more than one Profile?

Right now we only support one profile on the cloud but
this will change in the future.
