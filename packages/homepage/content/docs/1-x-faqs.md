## Which languages and frameworks are supported?

CodeSandbox works with JavaScript (including TypeScript) and has front-end and
full-stack support.

We've client templates for: React, Vue, Angular, Preact, Svelte, Dojo, CX,
Reason, as well as vanilla JavaScript that uses Parcel, and one for static
(HTML, JavaScript, CSS) projects.

We also have container templates for: Node.js, Angular, Adonis, Gatsby, Marko,
Nuxt, Next, Sapper, Apollo, Ember, Nest, Styleguidist, MDX Deck, Gridsome,
Quasar, Docusaurus and Vuepress.

[Create a sandbox from a template](https://codesandbox.io/s/), or read more
about the
[difference between client and container sandboxes](/docs/environment).

## How do I make a sandbox private?

You can set a sandbox as private in two main ways: From the editor, change the
privacy setting from the Privacy drop-down under Sandbox Info, and from the
dashboard right-click and select make private.

Note that a [Pro subscription](https://codesandbox.io/pricing) is required to
make sandboxes private or unlisted.

## I'm getting a 422 error when importing from GitHub, why?

There are a few possible reasons a repo might throw that error on import. The
most common are either a lack of a `package.json` file, or the project using
more than 500 modules (files). If you think it's something else, or you're not
able to solve this yourself, then [get in touch](mailto:support@codesandbox.io)
and provide a link to the repo you're importing and we can look into this for
you.

## Why are my start scripts not having an effect?

For performance reasons we ignore any specified scripts in client sandboxes,
instead using a default script. If you need to control the scripts, then we
recommend using a container sandbox.

## Can I change the Node version used in a container sandbox?

Yes. Container sandboxes run Node v10.20.1 (LTS) by default. However, you can
specify a `node` value to alter the version in `sandbox.config.json`, which will
be used instead. For further details, see [configuration](/docs/configuration).

## Can I open the terminal or console or test panel instead of the browser in a sandbox?

Yes, the terminal, console, and problems tabs are all draggable. Click on the
tab and drag it up into the bar alongside browser and tests. You can then
re-order those items by dragging them in that bar. Whichever is 1st from left to
right in the list of tabs is what opens first when other folks view the sandbox.
The ordering is maintained within the sandbox. You can also achieve this change
by setting a value for "view" in a
[sandbox config file](/docs/configuration#sandbox-configuration).

## How do I change the font used in the editor?

Ensure the font you want to use has been installed on your computer, then put
the name of it first in the comma-separated list under 'Editor: Font Family'
from File > Preferences > Settings in the editor.

## Are there any limitations with sandboxes?

- A sandbox cannot use more than 500 modules (files). Note though that
  `node_modules` and dependencies are not counted towards this limit.
- Imported sandboxes must contain a package.json file.
- The maximum file size that can be opened in the editor is 2MB. Files uploaded
  that are larger than that still exist but are linked as a static asset.
- The maximum file upload size is 7MB. If you need this raised, please
  [email us](mailto:support@codesandbox.io) with your username and the typical
  type and size of files you want to upload.
- In container sandboxes, there is a sync limit of 10 files per second and only
  files up to 2MB are synced with the editor. Files larger than that still exist
  but are not shown in the editor's file tree. You're still able to write and
  read to and from them in your code and they can be seen and edited via the
  terminal.
- Terminal commands which alter the filesystem of the container instance aren't
  synced with files shown in the editor. You'll need to refresh to see files
  updated this way.
- Container sandboxes sleep after around 10 minutes and can be woken by opening
  the sandbox or preview in a web browser.
- Container sandboxes have a 1GB persistent storage limit, a 1GB vCPU soft
  limit, and a hard memory limit of 2GB.

## I'm getting a 'Request Entity too Large' error, what should I do?

If you encounter this error when importing or committing, check your sandbox or
repo for large binary files and remove them.

## Can I use a database on CodeSandbox?

Yes. Container sandboxes on CodeSandbox have a persistent filesystem, so you're
able to use file-based database options like
[SQLite](https://codesandbox.io/s/sqlite3-sequelize-example-starter-lst3n),
[Lowdb](https://codesandbox.io/s/lowdb-json-file-database-example-starter-pldy5),
and [NeDB](https://codesandbox.io/s/nedb-example-starter-kyv7s). For more
powerful databases, like MongoDB, MySQL etc. we recommend using a third-party
host, like
[MongoDB Atlas](https://codesandbox.io/s/mongodb-database-example-starter-v3ker),
and interacting with them via an API/SDK.

## How do I change the editor theme?

You can change the theme from File > Preferences > Color Theme in the editor.

You can also set a custom VS Code theme. Open VS Code, Press (CMD or CTRL) +
SHIFT + P, Enter: '> Developer: Generate Color Scheme From Current Settings',
copy the contents and paste it into Preferences > Appearance from the top-right
avatar menu. After completing that you need to reload the browser and select
"Custom" as your color theme from File > Preferences > Color Theme.

## I can't edit my code because of an infinite loop

While we do have infinite loop protection as a
[configurable option](https://codesandbox.io/docs/configuration) it doesn't
prevent all scenarios where infinite loops can occur, such as with incomplete
code. When this happens, you can append `runonclick=1` to the editor URL to stop
the code from being automatically executed enabling you to edit your code to
resolve it. For example:
[https://codesandbox.io/s/new?runonclick=1](https://codesandbox.io/s/new?runonclick=1)

## How do I cancel my Pro or Patron plan?

For Pro users, you can cancel your subscription on the
[Pro page](https://codesandbox.io/pro). For legacy Patron users, you can cancel
your subscription on the [Patron page](https://codesandbox.io/patron).
