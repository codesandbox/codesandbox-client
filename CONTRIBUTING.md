## Code of Conduct

We have a code of conduct you can find [here](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and every
contributor is expected to obey the rules therein. Any issues or PRs that don't
abide by the code of conduct may be closed.

## Code Organization

The CodeSandbox client is currently divided in to 5 parts. We use `lerna` to
share dependencies between these parts.

- `app`: The editor, the search, profile page, the embed and the sandbox.
- `common`: All common parts between these packages, reusable JS.
- `codesandbox-api`: The npm package that's responsible for communication
  between the sandbox and the editor.
- `codesandbox-browserfs`: An in-browser file system that emulates the Node JS
  file system API and supports storing and retrieving files from various
  backends. Forked from
  [https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS](https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS), with
  an additional
  [CodeSandbox backend](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client/blob/master/standalone-packages/codesandbox-browserfs/src/backend/CodeSandboxFS.ts).

This version of CodeSandbox is using the production server as source of truth,
this is specified by the environment variable `LOCAL_SERVER`. If you're working
on a feature that needs you to be logged in, you can login on
[https://codesandbox.io/](https://codesandbox.io/) and copy the contents of the
`jwt` local storage key over to your development environment on
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). **Be very careful with how you
handle the token**, as anyone who knows it can login as you and have read/write
access to all your CodeSandbox content!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_
series

## Setting Up the project locally

To install the project you need to have `yarn` and `node`

1.  [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone
    your fork:

    ```sh
    # Clone your fork
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/codesandbox-client.git

    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
    cd codesandbox-client
    ```

2.  Your environment needs to be running Node v. 10
    - `.nvmrc` config exists in the repo root, specifying a v.10.x.x version
    - you can use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) (`fnm use`) to change
      your current node version to the one specified in `.nvmrc`
3.  from the root of the project: `yarn` to install all dependencies
    - make sure you have latest `yarn` version
4.  from the root of the project: `yarn start`
    - this builds the dependencies (`codesandbox-api` and
      `codesandbox-browserfs`) and runs the `app` development environment,
      available on [http://localhost:3000/s/new](http://localhost:3000/s/new)
    - on subsequent runs you can also bypass dependencies building and use
      `yarn start:fast`

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```sh
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.

5. If you want to debug the state of the app, use `npx overmind-devtools` and make sure that the app is running. Learn more [here](https://overmindjs.org/core/devtools).

## Submitting a Pull Request

Please go through existing issues and pull requests to check if somebody else is
already working on it, we use `someone working on it` label to mark such issues.

Also, make sure to run the tests and lint the code before you commit your
changes.

```sh
yarn test
yarn lint
```

Before running `yarn lint`, you must have build our `common` and `notifications`
packages.

```sh
yarn build:deps
```
