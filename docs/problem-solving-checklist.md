# Problem-Solving Accuracy Checklist
- Define: goal, constraints, assumptions, stakeholders, success criteria, deadline.
- Evidence: inputs, data sources, error budgets, known edge cases.
- Plan: options with trade-offs, chosen path, rollback.
- Execute: deterministic seed, idempotent steps, timeouts, retries (bounded).
- Validate: assertions, golden tests, invariants, acceptance criteria met.
- Document: decisions, risks, follow-ups; attach logs/artifacts.
