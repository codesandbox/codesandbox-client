As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.\") which specifies how the cell's context should be aligned horizontally within the cells in the row; this is shorthand for using `align` on every cell in the row individually. Possible values are:\n\n`left`\n\nAlign the content of each cell at its left edge.\n\n`center`\n\nCenter the contents of each cell between their left and right edges.\n\n`right`\n\nAlign the content of each cell at its right edge.\n\n`justify`\n\nWiden whitespaces within the text of each cell so that the text fills the full width of each cell (full justification).\n\n`char`\n\nAlign each cell in the row on a specific character (such that each row in the column that is configured this way will horizontally align its cells on that character). This uses the `[char](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr#attr-char)` and `[charoff](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr#attr-charoff)` to establish the alignment character (typically \".\" or \",\" when aligning numerical data) and the number of characters that should follow the alignment character. This alignment type was never widely supported.\n\nIf no value is expressly set for `align`, the parent node's value is inherited.\n\nInstead of using the obsolete `align` attribute, you should instead use the CSS [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align \"The text-align CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of an inline or table-cell box. This means it works like vertical-align but in the horizontal direction.\") property to establish `left`, `center`, `right`, or `justify` alignment for the row's cells. To apply character-based alignment, set the CSS [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align \"The text-align CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of an inline or table-cell box. This means it works like vertical-align but in the horizontal direction.\") property to the alignment character (such as `\".\"` or `\",\"`)."
